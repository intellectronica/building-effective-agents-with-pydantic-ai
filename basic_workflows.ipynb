      "\n",
      "   *Impact*: As the market experiences price volatility due to supply chain disruptions, inflation, or changes in raw material costs, price-sensitive customers will be directly affected. An increase in prices could lead to decreased purchasing power, while a decrease might increase demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "   *Recommended Actions*:\n",
      "   - Introduce flexible pricing models, such as subscription-based services or tiered pricing, to provide more options at different price points.\n",

      "   - Navigate to the login page of your account and select \"Forgot Password?\"\n",
      "   - Enter your email address or username associated with the account.\n",

      "3. **Account Security Verification:**\n",

The issue revolves around payment discrepancies, which falls under the scope of the billing team. The billing team is responsible for addressing questions about charges, adjusting subscriptions, and handling financial transactions, making them the most appropriate to address her concern.\n",

      "Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the unexpected charge on your card.\n",

      "Upon reviewing your account, I can confirm that the charge of $49.99 was indeed processed. It appears that your account was automatically upgraded to a plan that costs $49.99, which may have led to this discrepancy. The upgrade could have been initiated if there was an adjustment in your service needs or an automatic feature enhancement associated with your account settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "To resolve this, I will:\n",
      "1. Verify your subscription details and make sure your account reflects the plan you originally intended to subscribe to.\n",
      "2. Initiate a refund for the difference of $20, ensuring you are only charged the $29.99 as per your intended plan. Please allow 3-5 business days for the refund to be processed and to reflect on your card.\n",
      "3. Confirm any modifications to your account settings to prevent future occurrences.\n",

      "Selected route: technical\n",
      "Technical Support Response:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Access Export Feature**: \n",
      "   - Open the project management application you're using.\n",
      "   - Navigate to the section where your project data is stored.\n",
      "   - Look for an 'Export' or 'Export Data' option, generally available in the 'File' or 'Menu' toolbar.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Select Data to Export**:\n",
      "   - Once in the export section, you will need to choose the data you wish to export. \n",
      "   - There should be options to select specific projects or choose 'Select All' for a complete export.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Choose Export Format**: \n",
      "   - Select 'Excel' or 'CSV' as your export format. Most applications support direct export to Excel or provide CSV format, which can then be opened with Excel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **System Requirements**:\n",
      "   - Ensure you have Excel 2013 or later version installed on your system.\n",
      "   - The application should support bulk data export functionality (consult the specific application guide for detailed capabilities).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Initiate Export**:\n",
      "   - Click the 'Export' button after confirming your selections.\n",
      "   - Choose the destination on your device where the Excel file will be saved.\n",
      "   - You might be prompted to name the file or confirm download location.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Verify and Troubleshoot**:\n",
      "   - After the export, open the file in Excel to verify all the data has been exported accurately.\n",
      "   - If data appears missing or garbled, ensure your system supports the file format and version compatibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Common Problems**:\n",
      "   - If the 'Export' option is inaccessible, check your user permissions. You may need administrative access.\n",
      "   - In case of export limits (like number of rows), perform multiple exports of subsets of data if necessary.\n",
      "   \n",
      "8. **Escalation Path**:\n",
      "   - If you encounter issues beyond these steps, reach out to your IT department for additional access rights.\n",
      "   - Contact [Application Name] Support directly by visiting their support page or calling their helpline.\n",
