The urgency of needing to submit a report by end of day makes this a high-priority issue, needing prompt attention.

      "2. **Check Email**: After requesting a password reset, check your email inbox (including spam/junk folders) for a password reset link. This link is usually sent within 10-15 minutes.\n",

      "3. **Secure Connection**: When resetting your password, ensure you are on a trusted device and secure network to avoid unauthorized interception of your credentials.\n",

      "The charge of $49.99 on your account may be due to an upgrade or a recent promotion ending that you might not have intentionally subscribed to. Our records show that the $29.99 plan was the previous option, but if any changes were made or additional features added, this could result in the increased billing amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's what we can do next:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I will review your account details and plan history to verify any changes or upgrades. This will take approximately 1-2 business days.\n",
      "2. If it turns out to be an error, we will process a credit adjustment of $20 to your account, so you are billed correctly for the $29.99 plan.\n",
      "3. I will send you a confirmation email once this is resolved or if we need any additional information from you.\n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure no future discrepancies, please review your chosen plan from your account settings. You have the option to revert back to the $29.99 plan if an upgrade is detected.\n",

      "\n",
      "**System Requirements:**\n",
      "- Ensure your web browser is up-to-date for compatibility with your application.\n",
      "- Excel or any software capable of opening .xlsx files should be installed on your computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Problems and Workarounds:**\n",
      "- If you do not see the export option, ensure your user role has the correct permissions.\n",
      "- If the export button is unresponsive, clear your browser cache or try a different browser.\n",
      "- Some systems might limit the amount of data exported per operation. If you hit a data limit, try exporting in batches.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Escalation Path:**\n",
      "- If the issue persists or you encounter an error during the export process, please contact your IT department or the technical support team of the application provider for further assistance.
