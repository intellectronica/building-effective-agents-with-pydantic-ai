      "## 1. Capacity Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact\n",
      "- **Flexibility & Scalability:** Suppliers may struggle to meet demand fluctuations due to limited production capacity, leading to backlogs and dissatisfied customers.\n",
      "- **Operational Bottlenecks:** High demand periods could cause operational inefficiencies, longer lead times, and potential loss of business to more agile competitors.\n",
      "- **Quality Control Issues:** Expanding capacity rapidly sometimes compromises quality, affecting brand reputation and long-term client relationships.\n",

      "1. **Reset Your Password**: \n",
      "   - Go to the login page of your account and click on \"Forgot Password?\"\n",

      "Resolution Time Expectations:\n",

This upgrade might have been due to settings configured in your account preferences to enable such changes automatically.\n",

      "1. **Account Verification**: We will need to verify this change with your account history to ensure no other alterations were made without your consent. This process will take approximately 1-2 business days.\n",
      "2. **Plan Adjustment**: If confirmed as a mistake, we will revert your plan back to the $29.99 tier and issue a refund for the difference. This adjustment and refund process typically takes another 3-5 business days.\n",
      "3. **Notification**: You will receive an email confirmation once the refund is processed and when your plan settings have been reverted.\n",
