      "\n",
      "#### 1. Capacity Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impacts:**\n",
      "- **Production Delays**: Suppliers may face difficulties in meeting increased demand due to limited production capacity. This can result in bottlenecks and delays in delivery schedules.\n",
      "- **Increased Operational Costs**: To overcome capacity constraints, suppliers might need to invest in expanding production facilities or hiring additional workforce, leading to higher operational costs.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Recommended Actions:**\n",
      "- **Negotiate Long-term Contracts**: Establish long-term contracts with suppliers to lock in prices and provide them with financial stability.\n",
      "- **Value Engineering**: Collaborate with suppliers on value engineering to reduce costs without compromising on product quality.\n",
      "- **Cost-sharing Initiatives**: Develop cost-sharing initiatives for critical materials or components to distribute financial burdens.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Tech Transitions\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impacts:**\n",
      "- **Technology Investments**: Suppliers need to invest in new technologies to keep up with industry trends and customer demands, which can be capital intensive.\n",
      "- **Skills Gaps**: Transitioning to newer technologies may require suppliers to seek additional training for their workforce, leading to potential skill gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Actions:**\n",
      "- **Support Technological Advancements**: Provide technical support or incentives for suppliers to upgrade their technologies, ensuring alignment with industry standards.\n",

      "1. **Password Reset:**\n",
      "   - If you are certain your password is correct yet still cannot log in, it is advisable to reset your password. Click the \"Forgot Password?\" link on the login page.\n",
      "   - Follow the instructions sent to your registered email address to set a new password.\n",

      "1. I will initiate a review to confirm the upgrade details and adjust your plan back to $29.99 if it was unintentional. This process takes up to 2 business days.\n",
      "2. Once confirmed, a refund for the difference of $20 will be processed back to your credit card within 5 to 7 business days.\n",

      "- If there is no direct export option, consider copying data manually into an Excel sheet. Alternatively, check if your software supports exporting in CSV format, which Excel can also open.\n",
