Code examples for the agentic AI patterns discussed in the excellent article
[Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
by [Erik Schluntz](https://github.com/eschluntz) and [Barry Zhang](https://github.com/ItsBarryZ)
of Anthropic.

The examples rely on [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), an agentic AI
orchestration library that is particularly well-suited for implementing these patterns
with clarity and precision.

These examples complement the original code accompanying the
article and hopefully serve a dual purpose, demonstrating both the foundational agentic AI
patterns discussed in the article and the use of Pydantic AI.

To run:
1. Copy `dot.env` to `.env`
2. Fill in the API keys for your LLM provider(s)
3. Set `AI_MODEL` to the model you want to use
   (see https://ai.pydantic.dev/models/ for supported providers and models)

For example:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-123456789
AI_MODEL=openai:gpt-4o
```
