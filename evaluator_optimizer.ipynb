      "1. **Code Correctness**: The implementation correctly manages a main stack and a min stack to achieve constant time operations for push, pop, and getMin. However, there are scenarios such as attempting to pop or getMin from an empty stack that are not handled, which can lead to runtime errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Time Complexity**: The operations push, pop, and getMin are indeed implemented to work in O(1) time complexity by utilizing an auxiliary stack to track the minimum values.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Style and Best Practices**: The code is clean and follows Pythonic conventions overall. However, it is recommended to add type annotations to function parameters and return types to improve code clarity and maintainability. Additionally, error handling should be added for situations like popping from an empty stack or calling getMin when the stack is empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Documentation and Formatting**: The code includes comments explaining the purpose of each operation, which is good for readability. However, it lacks docstrings that describe the methods' behavior, parameters, and return values. Adding docstrings would greatly enhance the understandability and usability of the code.\n",
